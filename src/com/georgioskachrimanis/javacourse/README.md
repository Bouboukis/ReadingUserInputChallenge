 **Coding Challenge Reading User Input**
 
I have to build a method that will ask the user for 10 numbers, and then
 produce the sum of this numbers on the scree.
 If the user is not providing a valid value the program, will inform him and continue doing the same as long as the
 user is keep doing mistakes.
